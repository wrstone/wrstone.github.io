# GitHub Website

I've gotten rid of everything in sight.  Instead, I'm running an iframe full-windowed to the Floodgap Gopher proxy.

Why?  Because my personal website doesn't need a massive amount of Web attention, it needs a massive amount of text attention.

Also, guess what?  You know what's lasted the longest throughout human history?  Plain ol' text.

There's a place for Gopher, and I think I've found it.
